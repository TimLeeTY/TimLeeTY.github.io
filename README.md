This webpage is the closest thing I'm currently working on to a CV. It is currently obviously far from being completed, but when it is, it will hopefully contain all that there is to know about me whilst not being completely boring. I should also say that this is the first time I've delved into the markup horror that is HTML/CSS and I still have much to learn. The current version of the file showcases my efforts in starting HTML/CSS over the past fortnight (at the time of writing). There will be plenty of updates to come. Lastly, I do consider myself rather finicky about graphic design which is hopefully quite evident from the webpage itself, something I've been trying to master.
