This webpage is the closest thing I'm currently working on to a CV.
It is currently obviously far from being completed, but when it is, it will hopefully contain all that there is to know about me whilst not being completely boring.
I should also say that this is the first time I've delved into the markup horror that is HTML/CSS and I still have much to learn.
The current version of the file shocases my efforts in starting HTML/CSS over the past fortnight (at the time of writing).
There will hopefully be plenty of updates to come.
Lastly, I do consider myself picky when it comes to graphic design which I hope is quite evident from the webpage itself, which is what I've been trying to master recently
Although I would not say I'm particularly good at it.
